      <h1>I was born in Punjab, India and I did most of my schooling there.
         I came to Australia in 2013  and studied Diplomas in Engineering
          and a Diploma in Hospitality Management. After finishing my studies,
           I worked as a Chef for 5 years and then decided to stay permanently
            in Australia. <br><br> I love spending time with my two pet birds and I do
             try to stay active by attending 4-5 gym sessions every week with
              my friends. My interest in IT started when my dad bought his
              first Mobile Phone back in 1998, I was only 5 years old and
              the idea of being able to talk to someone on the move was
              fascinating.<br><br>
               Then few years later our town got Internet and
              my school got a new “Computer lab” then I compelled my dad buy
              me a computer. Our first computer was with 10gb hard drive, 128

               mb ram and with intel Pentium processor, it was running windows
                98. I was on that thing day and night just playing video games
                 like Mario, Dave, snakes etc. Ever since then I am interested
                  in a career in Information Technology. </h1>
