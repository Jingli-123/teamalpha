          What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of
          these rank in terms of demand from employers?
        </h1><br><br>
        <h2 style="font-size:20px; color:#F08080;">Anna Liu</h2>
        <p style="font-size:15px">
          I selected a UX/UI Designer for my ideal job. UI/UX designers develop
          the visual style and feel of a digital platform as it's presented to
          the user. <br>
          "User Experience (UX) Design is one of the fastest growing fields. If
          you think about the growth in smartphone and tablet sales, it’s not
          surprising that the field of UX is experiencing double digit growth.
          Every interaction you have with your device has in some way been
          influenced by a UX designer. Smartphone sales alone grew from 122
          Million in 2012 to 190.5 million units in 2015.  On the other hand,
          from 2012 to 2015, UX climbed up from #43 to #14 as the top 100 best
          jobs in America. With advances in virtual reality and the internet of
          things, the demand for UX Designers is only going to increase.(Ironhack, 2020)"
          <br><br>
          <h2 style="font-size:20px; color:#F08080;">Jing Li</h2>
          <p style="font-size:15px;">The ideal job I selected is Head of Software
             Engineering. <br>
             Software Engineer is an occupation for computer software design,
             develop, maintain, test, and evaluate. “Digital technology has become
             fundamental to Australian, businesses, the workforce, and the economy……
             digital technology played a crucial role in Australia’s response and enabled
             flexible working and remote education and healthcare. (ACS, 2022).”<br><br>
             IT job have experienced high growth since covid-19 impacted global economic
             change from 2019 to 2022. The huge demand of digital economy impacted the
             increasing of ICT workers and requires ICT skills applied in the other
             occupation. According to Labour Market Insights’ research, “Around 92%
             of people employed as Software Engineers work full-time hours, in all
             their jobs combined. This is 26 percentage points above all jobs average
             (66%).”<br><br>

          <h2 style="font-size:20px; color:#F08080;">Madhur Kamboj</h2>
          <p style="font-size:15px">
            I decided to pursue job as a Developer Programmer, where I will use
            technical skills and expertise which I will develop from this course
            to design and implement software solutions.<br>
            Developer Programmer Also known as Applications Developer, ICT Developer,
            or ICT Programmer, is one of those jobs which has always in demand and
            its demand will only increase in future. According to labour market
            insights it is in very high demand and it is ranked as very high skilled
            job. In LinkedIn only there are about 7000 jobs are listed which put this
            in one of the top ranked jobs in IT.<br><br></p>
            <h2 style="font-size:20px;color:#F08080;">Mark McMillan</h2>
            <p style="font-size:15px">
              The ideal job I chose is Mechatronics/Software/Robotics engineer.
              I suspect the advertisement pertains to a small company, since usually
              in this field, the positions are split between software and hardware
              duties. However, it would be great to learn the whole gamut of robotics
              and automation in an end to end manner, as the outcome of building an
              entire operating machine would I think be extremely satisfying. <br>
              The downside of choosing this position is that it does not fit in neatly
              within the categories of an IT position – the hardware side of things
              is probably better categorised as a mechanical engineering position.<br>
              There appears to be high demand for the skills needed by the candidate
              for the position. Pleasingly, the first photo in the Australia's tech
              future guide shows a technician working on a robotic arm. The same paper
              includes robotics skills as "facing current shortage".<br><br>
            </p><br><br>
          <h2 style="font-size:20px; color:#F08080;">Muhammad Zayd Abas</h2>
          <p style="font-size:15px">
            The ideal job I have chosen is an Embedded Software Engineer. Although
            this is a specific type of Software Engineering, there is a huge demand
            for software engineers across multiple industries all over Australia.
            LinkedIn returns more than 5000 available positions across Australia. (LinkedIn). <br>
            This shows the strong demand for Software Engineers. Software Engineering is also
            listed as having a strong future demand across all states. (National Skills Commission, 2021).<br><br>

              <h1 style="font-size:25px; color:#7FB3D5;">
                From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills
                required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's
                required skill set). These can be divided into general skills
                (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific
                skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).  </h1><br><br>

                  Software engineering is all about using the best techniques to
                  deliver on business/systems specifications. Almost each line of
                  code is written to solve some type of problem or challenge! <br>
                  I understand that IT focussed organisations highly value teamwork
                  as this RMIT course features a number of team based subjects, that
                   would be requested by companies. Another aspect of IT work
                   specifically is that the field, while becoming more complex
                   in line with the modern world, can usually be split into m
                   odules, which can be worked on by team members who efficiently
                   collaborate to deliver the final product.

                  The top 3 IT skills listed are not required by the position i.e. SQL,

                   processes are usually dedicated to fulfilment of a specific task, for example
                    performed at a point on a production line. These processes will not usually
                    require access to a database or Java tools which are usually used in conjunction
                     with user interactions on a graphical computer or more general business

                  Learning how my ideal job fit into the grand scheme of labour demand shed some light on what I'd be getting into if I pursued a career as a UX/UI designer. Despite it being an unconventional and niche job, it is slowly rising in demand due to more and more services being digitalised. UI designers are consistently placed as being in-demand jobs, according to LinkedIn. There might be even more demand for UI designers with the advent of zero-touch UI(Stevens 2021). Both of these facts make this position and exciting proposition for me, and have changed my opinion of it for the better.

                  My opinion of my ideal job has not changed. Because my ideal job basic on interesting, and the demanding is increasing in the next few years in Australia. Even now, the high employment rate-57.9% in bachelor’s degree (Labour Market Insights, 2021) which gave me a lot of confidence that I can achieve my goal in the future. Also, inclusive is become the tide of the times, while women to men employed in STEM continues to trend towards balance, the proportion of women still lower than men in technology sector area which reached 31% in 2022. Based on this, industry giants encourage women to enroll in training course or high education, they provide friendly environment to help women who willing to join STEM area. I believe now is the best beginning for women who want to change their career and gain the bigger achievement in the future.

                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                  My preference of my ideal job has not changed. My view is
                  (while avoiding getting too philosophical) is it is still
                  better to chase a (realistic) dream rather than being guided
                  too much about what is in demand (and therefore pays well). <br>
                  Remembering that working life occupies roughly a 3rd of ones
                  working week (8 hrs work, 8 hrs recreation, 8hrs sleep), it is
                  important that the vocation chosen is satisfying. However I can
                   fully understand why a young person entering the workforce now
                    will wish to maximise their full time job prospects and earning
                    capacity due to cost of living factors, especially accounting for
                    the cost of buying a house in a capital city.  <br>
                    In my case, where, due to age factors, it is highly improbable
                    that I will attain a mechanical engineering degree necessary for
                     this actual job. I would need to rely on experiences with developing
                      real world automation projects on Pi's or Arduino's for example when
                      applying. However, as mentioned, many positions in the
                      robotics/automation field have specialist software developers
                      that work in tandem with hardware (engineering) experts.

                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                  My Ideal job has not changed as I have realised that a lot of
                  specific skills needed for my job can be found in the top charts.
                  I also believe that the ideal job I wish to pursue should be something
                  I enjoy (which is already in high demand) rather than something that is
                   in even higher demand and pays better.<br>
                   Especially in IT, most jobs are in high demand, and I feel that
                    as long as you are working in the IT industry, there will always
                     be many job opportunities. I am confident that my Ideal job will
                     be in high demand now and in the future as IT becomes more applies
                     in our daily lives.
