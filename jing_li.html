				My name is Jing Li, and I am one of the members of Team Alpha. 
				I came from China and lived in Melbourne about 10 years. I have worked in Education field for 20 years. I grew up in China and decided to move to Australia as I wanted to see a different world. I'm interested in Sci-fi and read a lot of Sci-fi novels. I also like to play video games and watch movies when I have time. I enjoy painting and trying new food with my family. My first exposure to IT was in 1991, my motherâ€™s company bought an Apple computer - the Macintosh Performa 6310, and since then, I fell in love with computer games. I started to think about the programming was fun in the "ICT in education" course I did last year. Our final assignment was to build a short Scratch project to apply in teaching. I couldn't find a word to describe my feelings when I finally finished my project. Since then, I realize that programming is more fun than games even if it's a big challenge for me.
